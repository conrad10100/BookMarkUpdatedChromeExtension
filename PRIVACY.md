My Bookmark Updater does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing information to external servers. All data, including bookmarks and extension settings, are stored locally in your browser and are not shared with third parties.
The extension only uses the permissions required to manage your bookmarks and interact with the current browser tab.

If you have any questions or concerns about privacy, please contact the developer via the support page on the Chrome Web Store.
